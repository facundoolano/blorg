jorge is a personal static site generator, inspired by Jekyll. In this context, I[fn:1] use personal as "small and opinionated". In practical terms, this means that jorge implements the subset of features from Jekyll that I find most useful, and that I defaulted to Jekyll design decisions except in the specific cases where I had strong differing preferences.

jorge started as a Golang learning project, aimed at streamlining my blogging workflow. It adds native org-mode syntax support and, at least for my website, it turned out to be much faster than Jekyll. jorge should /almost/ work as a drop-in replacement for Jekyll: the directory structure is a bit different but most of the content should render with few changes. Additionally, I tried to add support to generate a fully functional (albeit minimalist and kind of ugly) website from scratch.

This tutorial covers the basics of using jorge, from starting a site to deploying it. I tried to keep it accessible, but you may need to consult with Jekyll or Hugo documentation if you never used a static site generator, want to get the finer-grained details of template syntax, etc.

Next: [[file:jorge-init][start a website]].
