I'm set out to write a little static site generator, but why?

*** Why this project?
I wanted to learn the Go programming language, and my preferred way to learn a new language is to apply it on some open source project I'm interested in[fn:1].

*** Why Go?

In the past I studied new programming languages to broaden my horizons,
to add better, more sophisticated tools to my toolbox: new programming paradigms, concurrency models or type systems. Because I never used it in college and never needed it for work, and because it seemed to lack this "novelty factor", I never got around to trying Go.

But over the last few years, there has been a shift in how I assign value to technology. For all of the learning value of trying different things and broadening your horizons, I find the choice of sophisticated technology hard to justify for most real-world projects; in the long-term, the complexity they add outweighs the value they bring. And, in turn, I've became less and less enthusiastic about studying technology that I don't expect to ever use ---that I wouldn't dare to inflict to the real-world.

The very reason why I had avoided Go in the past, now compelled me to give it a try:
Go seemed to be an unpretentious, boring language ---and I mean that as [[https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology][a compliment]]---, one that combined many of the good features I came to value (or miss) elsewhere:

- Easy to learn.
- Fast-enough.
- Garbage collected.
- Compiled to binary, making it easy to distribute and operate.
- With a static type system that's neither astonishing nor bureaucratic.
- With a powerful concurrency model that's built into the language rather than an afterthought.

That's the idea I had about the language, from reading about it but having never used it. If these presumptions turned out to be right, Go could become a reasonable default for many of my future projects ---and a good boring tech radar.

*** Why a command-line application?

*** Why a static site generator?

** Notes

[fn:1] I did it before with [[https://github.com/facundoolano/advenjure][Clojure]] and [[https://github.com/facundoolano/rpg-cli][Rust]].
