** Indeed

This post was originally written with org-mode syntax, instead of [[file:goodbye-markdown][markdown]].

As you can see, /italics/ and *bold* render as expected, and you can even use footnotes[fn:1].

All of this is powered by [[https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org][go-org]], btw[fn:2].

** Notes

[fn:1] See?

[fn:2] And another one footnote, to stay on the safe side.
